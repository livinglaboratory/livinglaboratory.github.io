						<h2>Abstract</h2>
						<p>The Bay of Fundy, spanning 1,394 acres between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, is known for its record tides and rich biodiversity (Delong, 1996). Understanding its current state requires looking at its geological history, which shaped its landscape and established the foundation for its ecosystem. Human activity has also left lasting impacts on the bay's land, water, and wildlife. By examining these historical layers, we can gain insights into its evolution, the role of human influence, and how to protect it for future generations.</p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>The Bay of Fundy and its surrounding ecosystems weave an intricate tapestry of biodiversity and resilience. However, as climate change increasingly impacts these areas, the need for conservation and protection becomes ever more urgent. The fate of countless species hangs in the balance, underscoring the interconnectedness of life as both a source of strength and a call to action.</p>
						<p>In response to these challenges, Ernie and Judy Edwards, the owners of Deadman's Head Forest, have adopted a minimal disruption approach to land management. Their focus on preserving the forest's natural state reflects a deep commitment to reducing human impact and allowing the area to thrive as a sanctuary for biodiversity. While remnants of fishing equipment serve as evidence of past human activity, these disturbances are balanced by efforts to mitigate harm and promote conservation.</p>
						<p>Working alongside The Nature Trust of New Brunswick, the Edwards are helping ensure that the forest remains a resilient “living laboratory” for research and education. This partnership fosters responsible stewardship, illustrating that even amid the pressures of climate change and human activity, hope remains. The Bay of Fundy's ecosystems remain a powerful testament to resilience. Through thoughtful conservation and sustainable management, we can protect cherished sites like Deadman's Head, ensuring they continue to inspire education, deepen our connection to nature, and instill hope for future generations.</p>
